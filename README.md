# 60 percent keyboard emulator

This [AutoHotkey](https://autohotkey.com/) script is designed to emulate the operation of a 60% keyboard. 

As a hardware part, you can use any traditional keyboard.

The script remaps the keys so that the navigation and auxiliary keys are available from the main keyboard block.

For example, the first layer with remapped keys looks like this:

Thus, you can test whether it will be convenient for you to work on a 60% keyboard.

The script can also be used with a regular keyboard. It will give you some extra features.
