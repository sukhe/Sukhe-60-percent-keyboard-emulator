# Sukhe-60-percent-keyboard-emulator

This script is designed to emulate the operation of a 60% keyboard. As a hardware part, you can use any traditional keyboard.

The script remaps the keys so that the navigation and auxiliary keys are available from the main keyboard block.

This makes it possible to test whether it will be convenient for you to work on a 60 percent keyboard. And if so - buy the appropriate keyboard.

The script can also be used with a regular keyboard. It will add more features to you.

The script features are described in more detail in the following articles:
